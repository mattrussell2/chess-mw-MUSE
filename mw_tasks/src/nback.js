    Stimuli were pseudorandom sequences of consonants randomly varying in case and presented in a fixed central location on a computer screen using the PsyScope software (Cohen, MacWhinney, Flatt, & Provost, 1993) for a 500-ms duration with a 2500-ms interstimulus interval. Participants completed 12 blocks of trials (three blocks of each of the four conditions), with each block consisting of 25 trials. The first three trials of each block were never targets and of the remaining trials 30% were targets. Condition order was randomized across blocks and across participants, with the constraint that all four conditions were sampled in every set of four blocks. A short break (5â€“20 s) between blocks was provided to allow participants to rest. Prior to the start of the actual task, participants were trained on each of the four conditions. Participants were given up to three practice blocks (of 25 trials each) per condition with feedback on their performance, until they demonstrated that they understood the task and their performance stabilized. Reaction times (RTs) and accuracy measures were obtained for each trial.
